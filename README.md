# news_classification
The task made by this project is to classify the news. If the topic is "Football" the news is disliked, else it's liked. I used Python in this project. The final model is with LSTM. 

#Dataset
The dataset contains 600 news together containing name, snippets and topic. The dataset format is json.

#Realised Work
The realised work is inside the jupyter notebook. 
* I imported the data
* Realised some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Preprocessed Data
* Trained a Naive Bayes Model
* Trained an LSTM model
